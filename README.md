## 🎯 Objective
To analyze patterns of employee attrition using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and uncover key factors that influence why employees leave an organization.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

- 📌 Cleaned and explored the HR dataset
- 📌 Calculated overall attrition rate
- 📌 Visualized department-wise attrition trends
- 📌 Compared attrition rates based on project workload (<3 vs ≥3)
- 📌 Analyzed the influence of salary levels on attrition
- 📌 Explored relationship between tenure and project load

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- `department_attrition.png` – Employees who left by department
- `projects_vs_attrition.png` – Attrition by project workload
- `salary_vs_attrition.png` – Salary distribution comparison
- `experience_vs_projects.png` – Tenure vs workload (scatterplot)
